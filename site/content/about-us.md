    title: Our origins
    leadtext: In 2011, during an informal conversation, three senior business
      leaders agreed to collaborate and bring together a cohort of business
      leaders from across the City of London to address the increasing levels of
      stress in the workplace and to challenge existing work practices that they
      felt were counterproductive to the quality of client service,
      profitability and health of employees.  Poppy Jaman OBE, the co-founder of
      Mental Health First Aid England came on board as Program Director and is
      now the CMHA’s CEO. With seed funding from their respective organisations,
      the three senior business leaders launched CMHA in the UK with 10
      participating firms in October 2012.
