    title: Our origins
    leadtext: In 2011, during an informal conversation, three senior business
      leaders agreed to collaborate and bring together a cohort of business
      leaders from across the City of London to address the increasing levels of
      stress in the workplace and to challenge existing work practices that they
      felt were counterproductive to the quality of client service,
      profitability and health of employees.  Poppy Jaman OBE, the co-founder of
      Mental Health First Aid England came on board as Program Director and is
      now the CMHA’s CEO. With seed funding from their respective organisations,
      the three senior business leaders launched CMHA in the UK with 10
      participating firms in October 2012.

    title: What we do
    content: >-
      CMHAA works hand in hand with members, at a leadership and operational
      level, to facilitate change and embed good mental health practice within
      workplaces in a practical, sustainable and measurable way. We do this by:


      Socialising mental heath into the business. Increasing understanding of mental health, challenging any stigma, and fostering a culture of openness within the workplace.



      Developing skills and mental health literacy. Providing all employees with the appropriate language and confidence to talk about mental health, as well as facilitating training and sharing best practice.



      Sustaining and embedding the change. Helping to ensure that good mental health practice is lead and owned by business leaders and becomes integrated into the business’s strategic priorities. 



      Our strength lies in the unique collaboration of our members, working together to draw upon the vast pool of knowledge and experience from across business, and with guidance from our expert advisors, to find, test and deliver solutions that work for our members.
