    title: Who we are
    leadtext: "We are a business-led, expert-guided alliance of Australian business
      leaders who have come together for the first time, united in our focus to
      facilitate change and embed good mental health practice within workplaces
      in a sustainable and measurable way. "
    content: Why? Because we know that we can do better, and that doing better
      begins with business leaders prioritising mental health in ways that are
      experienced by all of their employees. We also know that when businesses
      pool their knowledge and resources and work with each other in a
      collaborative, non-competitive way, more sustainable outcomes can be
      achieved for our people, and for the wider community.
